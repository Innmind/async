# Structure of all components

- Scheduler
    - parameterized with a carry value (sink pattern)
- Task (from a callable)
    - uninitialized
    - suspended
    - resumable
    - terminated
    - ðŸ‘† Fiber terminology
- Scope (from a callable)
    - uninitialized
    - suspended
    - resumable (when suspension is fulfilled)
    - restartable
    - wakeable (when a task result is available)
    - terminated
- Suspension
    - from IO wait
    - from process halt
    - resumable (halt finished)
    - ready (IO stream ready)
- Wait
    - Scope
    - Sequence<Task>
    - Results (Sequence<mixed>, untypable as it's recursive definition)
        - in from previous iteration
        - out augmented with terminated tasks
